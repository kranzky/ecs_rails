module EcsRails
  # The class/relation-level query DSL: filter entities by which components they
  # have.
  #
  # Implements RFC-0010, decided by ADR-0011. Surfaced by the demo, where every
  # list view hand-rolled a cross-component subquery whose correctness silently
  # rode the entity's default_scope.
  #
  #   Post.with_component(PublishState, state: "published")  # posts that HAVE a
  #                                                          # matching row
  #   User.without_component(Avatar)                         # users with NO avatar
  #   Post.with_component(Name).with_component(Avatar)       # AND — chainable
  #
  # Extended into EcsRails::Entity, so these are class methods on every entity
  # class. ActiveRecord delegates class methods to relations (via `scoping`), so
  # `Post.where(...).with_component(...)` chains too: the method runs with `all`
  # returning the current relation, which already carries the entity-model scope.
  #
  # ## Why EXISTS, not JOIN (ADR-0011)
  #
  # Each call compiles to a correlated `EXISTS` / `NOT EXISTS` subquery rather
  # than a join: EXISTS matches an entity once (no duplicate rows), N calls are N
  # independent `AND EXISTS` clauses that compose without table aliasing, and
  # `NOT EXISTS` is the natural, NULL-safe form of "without" (unlike `NOT IN` or a
  # `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL`).
  #
  # ## Why the entity-model scope is correct for free (ADR-0011)
  #
  # A component table is blind to entity type — `Name` has rows for Users *and*
  # Posts. The scope that keeps `Post.with_component(Name)` from returning Users
  # is NOT added by this DSL. It falls out of the method running on `all`, which
  # is Post's own default-scoped relation (`model = 'posts'`, ADR-0002). The DSL
  # only appends the `EXISTS` clause. Building from `unscoped` or from
  # `ApplicationEntity` would drop that scope and leak — so we build from `all`.
  module Querying
    # Entities that HAVE a row for `component_class` (RFC-0010). With
    # `conditions`, the row must also match them (hash equality, like `where`).
    #
    # Compiles to a correlated `EXISTS` subquery, so an entity matches once —
    # never duplicated as a join would. Condition values are sanitised by
    # ActiveRecord and treated as data, never SQL (ADR-0011).
    #
    # The component need *not* be declared on this entity: querying a component
    # the entity never declares is a valid, always-empty query, not an error.
    #
    # @example Filtering by a component's attributes
    #   Post.with_component(PublishState, state: "published")
    #
    # @example Chaining — each call ANDs
    #   Post.with_component(Title).with_component(Body).order(created_at: :desc)
    #
    # @param component_class [Class<EcsRails::Component>] a concrete component
    # @param conditions [Hash] optional attribute equality the row must match
    # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation] chainable, and still scoped to this
    #   entity's own `model` discriminator (ADR-0002)
    # @raise [EcsRails::InvalidComponent] if `component_class` is not a concrete
    #   component, or is abstract and so owns no table
    # @see #without_component
    # @see EcsRails::Relationships#with_related the relationship-name equivalent

      all.where(ecs_component_exists_sql(component_class, conditions, negate: false))
    end

    # Entities that have NO row for `component_class` (RFC-0010).
    #
    # Compiles to `NOT EXISTS`, which is the NULL-safe form of "without" — unlike
    # `NOT IN` or a `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL`.
    #
    # There is deliberately no conditions form: "without a *matching* row" is
    # ambiguous (see the RFC's Non-goals). A virtual/lazy component has no row, so
    # it counts as absent — the intuitive reading of "without" (ADR-0009).
    #
    # @example
    #   User.without_component(Avatar)
    #
    # @param component_class [Class<EcsRails::Component>] a concrete component
    # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation] chainable, entity-model scoped
    # @raise [EcsRails::InvalidComponent] if `component_class` is not a concrete
    #   component, or is abstract and so owns no table
    # @see #with_component
    def without_component(component_class)

    # Builds the `EXISTS (...)` / `NOT EXISTS (...)` fragment for one component.

    # The subquery is built from `component_class.where(conditions)` so that
    # ActiveRecord sanitises the condition values — they are treated as data,
    # never SQL, closing the injection hole (ADR-0011). The correlation is an
    # Arel column comparison, `component.entity_id = entities.id`, so it renders
    # as properly quoted identifiers against the OUTER entities table — never a
    # hand-built string.
    #
    # `arel_table` here is the entity class's own table (`entities`); the outer
    # query the fragment is appended to selects from that same table, so `id`
    # correlates to each candidate entity row.
